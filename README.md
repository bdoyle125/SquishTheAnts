SquishTheAnts is a game made using p5.js, where the user has 30 seconds to squish 30-40 ants that run horizontally and vertically at varying speeds. However, each ant that is squished startles the other ants, slightly increasing their collective speed. See if you can complete the challenge!

The ant asset was made myself using Piskel.
